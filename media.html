        <h1>What Are We?</h1>
        <p>We at Freakonomics are a group of teenagers who work with other teenagers to consult about the topic of "Teenage Anxiety" We aim to inform of others about other people's experiences with Anxiety, and how they deal with this serious issue that is prevalent to the youth, especially those in school.</p>

        <h1>Teenage Anxiety</h1>
        <p>Why exactly is our topic about Teenage Anxiety? This is because, as teenagers, we should be informed about the difference between being shy/nervous vs. having anxiety, as they are very similar, but things that should never be synonymous with each other.</p>

                <h3>Shyness</h3>
                <p>Shyness is a very common feeling that most, if not everyone have felt more than once. This can be because of self-conciousness, discomfort, or insecurities. This can leave people feeling shaky, struggling with speech and a pounding heartbeat.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Nervousness</h3>
                <p>Nervousness is a feeling of being uncomfortable, stress, restlessness, and being tense. This can be caused by bad past experiences and fear of the unknown. This is considered mild compared to Anxiety.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Anxiety</h3>
                <p>Anxiety is a very strong feeling of uneasiness, fear, and dread, this causes rapid heartbeat and intense sweating. Unlike Shyness and Nervousness, Anxiety is a mental disorder that affects people for a long time, even without any clear reason as to why. This can be treated with therapy or treatments that are readily available.</p>

<h1>Causes of Anxiety</h1>
        <h3>School/Work</h3>
        <p>In Highschool, Teenagers have expectations of themselves and of others, sometimes, these expectations are things that can never be met, or that they are overly exaggerated. And with these expectations, those that don't fit into expectations are targeted by bullies or of hazing.</p>

        <h3>Unpleasant Homes</h3>
        <p>Teenagers that have been badly mistreated by family members develop bad habits to cope with their experiences. As they say, there is no place like home, but if the home is mistreating and abusing the child, they are led to believe that this is normal in life.</p>

            <div>
                <p>We at Freakonomics plan to use Social Media to give students with Anxiety to speak their mind. Topics can be about what people's experiences are with Anxiety, how did their Anxiety start and how to avoid bad experiences that can lead to Anxiety.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="audience-col">
            <div>
                <p>With this, we hope that more and more students are aware of the seriousness of Anxiety, as this can lead to suicidal thoughts and even self-harm. With our platform, we hope that we can prevent future cases of severe Anxiety, starting from just a small circle of friends, to an ideal goal of a whole school.</p>
